import ScaladocLink from '@site/src/components/ScaladocLink';

Before you can broadcast a [newly created transaction](./transactions) to the blockchain, you must prove that you have the authority to
spend the input tokens. You can accomplish this using the SDK's Credentialler.

## Prerequisites

The following requires access to a Credentialler instance. You can initialize one using the following snippet:

```scala
val credentialler = CredentiallerInterpreter.make[F](walletApi, walletStateApi, mainKey)
```

Where `F` is a type parameter bound to a context parameter of type `Monad[F]`, `walletApi` is an instance of
a [Wallet Api](./wallets#prerequisites), `walletStateApi` is an initialized instance of
the <ScaladocLink path="co/topl/brambl/dataApi/WalletStateAlgebra.html"><code>WalletStateAlgebra</code></ScaladocLink>,
and `mainKey` is your ExtendedEd25519 Topl main key pair. See the `make`
function's <ScaladocLink path="co/topl/brambl/wallet/CredentiallerInterpreter$.html#make[F[_]](WalletApi[F],WalletStateAlgebra[F],KeyPair)(Monad[F]):Credentialler[F]"><code>signature</code></ScaladocLink>.
For example, if you are using Cats Effect `IO` and the default implementation of
the <ScaladocLink path="co/topl/brambl/servicekit/index.html"><code>ServiceKit</code></ScaladocLink>, you can initialize
a Credentialler as follows:

```scala
import cats.effect.IO
import co.topl.brambl.servicekit.{WalletKeyApi, WalletStateApi}
import co.topl.brambl.wallet.{CredentiallerInterpreter, WalletApi}
import co.topl.brambl.servicekit.WalletStateResource
import co.topl.crypto.signing.ExtendedEd25519
import co.topl.brambl.syntax.cryptoToPbKeyPair

// Replace with the location of your wallet state file
val DB_FILE = "wallet.db"
val walletConnection = WalletStateResource.walletResource(DB_FILE)

val walletApi = WalletApi.make[IO](WalletKeyApi.make())
val walletStateApi = WalletStateApi.make[IO](walletConnection, walletApi)
// Some mock key pair. Do not use. Replace with your Topl main key pair.
val mainKey = (new ExtendedEd25519).deriveKeyPairFromSeed(Array.fill(96)(0: Byte))

// Credentialler initialization starts:
val credentialler = CredentiallerInterpreter.make[IO](walletApi, walletStateApi, mainKey)
```

## Prove

You can prove a transaction using
the <ScaladocLink path="co/topl/brambl/wallet/Credentialler.html#prove(IoTransaction):F[IoTransaction]"><code>prove</code></ScaladocLink>
function of a Credentialler instance.

```scala
def prove(
  unprovenTx: IoTransaction
): F[IoTransaction]
```

This function takes in a transaction and proves every input by updating their attestations. Any existing proofs are persisted.
This is useful for partial proofs. For example, if an input is encumbered by an `And` lock, a partial proof could be that
only one of the `And` lock's sub-propositions is proven. In this case, calling this function will add the proof for the
second sub-proposition while leaving the first sub-proposition's proof intact.

The parameters are as follows:
- `unprovenTx`: The transaction to prove. As mentioned above, this transaction may already have some proofs. To obtain
a new transaction with no proofs, read [Build a Transaction](./transactions)

On success, this function returns the given transaction with updated proofs which can be broadcasted to the network.
This returned `IoTransaction` has the same signable bytes as the original transaction. If any of the contained propositions
are unable to be proven, their proofs will be left unchanged.

:::note
Proving a transaction does not guarantee that the transaction will be accepted by the network. The transaction may still be
rejected if it is malformed or if it is not sufficiently proven. For this reason, it is recommended to use
the [`proveAndValidate`](#prove-and-validate) function instead.
