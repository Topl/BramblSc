import ScaladocLink from '@site/src/components/ScaladocLink';

The wallet state keeps track of the child key pairs that have already been used to generate lock addresses. It also stores
the necessary information to prove the ownership of the lock addresses. Keeping an up-to-date wallet state is crucial for
proving your transactions.

## Prerequisites

Managing your Wallet State starts requires creating an instance of the <ScaladocLink path="co/topl/brambl/dataApi/WalletStateAlgebra.html"><code>WalletStateAlgebra</code></ScaladocLink>.
The SDK provides a default implementation within the [Service Kit](../service-kit/big-picture). This default
implementation uses SQLite as a database to store the wallet state.
