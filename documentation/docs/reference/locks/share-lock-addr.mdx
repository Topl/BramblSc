import ScaladocLink from '@site/src/components/ScaladocLink';

The SDK provides an easy way to share Lock Addresses with other users using a Base58 encoding scheme. This is useful
when you want to share a new address to receive funds.

## Encoding into Base58

You can encode a Lock Address into Base58 using
the <ScaladocLink path="co/topl/brambl/codecs/AddressCodecs$.html#encodeAddress(LockAddress):String"><code>encodeAddress</code></ScaladocLink>
function in the AddressCodecs object:

```scala
def encodeAddress(
  lockAddress: LockAddress
): String
```

This function takes in a Lock Address and returns it's Base58 string representation.

The parameters are as follows:
- `lockAddress`: The Lock Address to encode into Base58.

## Decoding from Base58

You can decode a Lock Address from Base58 using
the <ScaladocLink path="co/topl/brambl/codecs/AddressCodecs$.html#decodeAddress(String):Either[EncodingError,LockAddress]"><code>decodeAddress</code></ScaladocLink>
function in the AddressCodecs object:

```scala
def decodeAddress(
  address: String
): Either[EncodingError, LockAddress]
```

This function takes in a Base58 encoded String and returns the corresponding Lock Address if possible. If it is not
possible to decode the string into a Lock Address, an error will be returned.

The parameters are as follows:
- `address`: The Base58 string to decode into a Lock Address.

## Example

Using the `lockAddrResult` and the context `IO` from the [LockAddress example](./create-lock-addr#example) we can encode
and decode to-and-from Base58.

```scala
val base58Addr: IO[String] = lockAddrResult.map(encodeAddress)
val decodedAddr: IO[Either[EncodingError, LockAddress]] = base58Addr.map(decodeAddress)
```
