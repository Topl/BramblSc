:::caution
By the nature of the blockchain, a UTXO's lock is publicly
revealed once it's spent, rendering all other UTXOs encumbered by the same lock insecure and vulnerable to theft. To
prevent this, we strongly recommend that all other UTXOs encumbered by the same lock are moved to a new lock. Our functions
are designed to make this easy, however, it is up to the user to ensure that this is done.
