# Build a Merging Transaction

Our asset management system allows merging of distinct, yet compatible, asset tokens. The first step to merging these
existing asset tokens on the Blockchain is to build an unproven merging transaction. There are restrictions on the
types of tokens that can be merged. Continue reading to learn more.

## Merge Asset Tokens

You can create a transaction to merge asset tokens using
the <ScaladocLink path="co/topl/brambl/builders/TransactionBuilderApi.html#buildAssetMergeTransaction(Seq[TransactionOutputAddress],Seq[Txo],Map[LockAddress,Predicate],Long,LockAddress,LockAddress,Option[Struct],Option[ByteString]):F[Either[BuilderError,IoTransaction]]"><code>buildAssetMergeTransaction</code></ScaladocLink>
function of a Transaction Builder API instance.

```scala
def buildAssetMergeTransaction(
  utxosToMerge:           Seq[TransactionOutputAddress],
  txos:                   Seq[Txo],
  locks:                  Map[LockAddress, Lock.Predicate],
  fee:                    Long,
  mergedAssetLockAddress: LockAddress,
  changeAddress:          LockAddress,
  ephemeralMetadata:      Option[Struct] = None,
  commitment:             Option[ByteString] = None
): F[Either[BuilderError, IoTransaction]]
```

This function builds a transaction to merge existing distinct asset tokens to create a new type of asset. The asset
tokens to be merged must be considered compatible. The resulting merged asset token is considered an "alloy" asset. See
the note below for more information on compatible asset tokens.


The parameters are as follows:
- `utxosToMerge` - A sequence of TransactionOutputAddress representing the asset tokens to be merged. These asset tokens must be compatible with each other.
- `txos` - A sequence of TXOs to be the inputs of the created transaction. Any extra tokens that are not being merged or used as fees will be returned as change.
- `locks` - A map of LockAddress to Predicate Locks that encumber the funds in the txos. This will be used in the attestations of the txos' inputs.
- `fee` - The transaction fee. The txos must contain enough LVLs to satisfy this fee
- `mergedAssetLockAddress` - The LockAddress to send the resulting merged alloy asset to.
- `changeAddress` - The LockAddress to send any change to.
- `ephemeralMetadata` - Optional metadata to be included in merged alloy asset. The `ephemeralMetadata` of the input
assets will not be carried over to the resulting alloy asset and thus should be specified, if so desired. `ephemeralMetadata` and `commitment`
are the only fields in an asset that are not used in the merging process.
- `commitment` - Optional commitment to be included in the merged alloy asset. The `commitment` of the input assets will
not be carried over to the resulting alloy asset and thus should be specified, if so desired. `ephemeralMetadata` and `commitment`
are the only fields in an asset that are not used in the merging process.

:::note
To be considered compatible, assets must all share the same `fungibility` and `quantityDescriptor` types. The `fungibility`
type must be either `GROUP` or `SERIES`. If the assets are `GROUP` fungible, then they must all share the same `groupId`.
Similarly, if the assets are `SERIES` fungible, then they must all share the same `seriesId`.

### Example

The following example shows how to mint assets and then build a transaction to merge them. In this example, we first mint
a group constructor token and then mint 2 series constructor tokens. This is because we will create group fungible assets
that share a Group ID. Using these 3 constructor tokens, we mint 2 different group fungible assets in 2 separate transactions.
Finally, we merge these 2 group fungible assets into 1. Notice that we wait 15 seconds before re-querying Genus for spendable
UTXOs. This is because it takes some time for the transactions to be included in Genus. The delay on the Bifrost node,
however, is much shorter thus we were able to only wait 1 second in the example.
