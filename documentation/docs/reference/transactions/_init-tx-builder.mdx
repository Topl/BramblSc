The following guide requires access to a Transaction Builder Api instance. You can initialize one as follows using the
following snippet:

```
import co.topl.brambl.constants.NetworkConstants.{MAIN_NETWORK_ID, MAIN_LEDGER_ID}

val transactionBuilderApi = TransactionBuilderApi.make[F](MAIN_NETWORK_ID, MAIN_LEDGER_ID)
```

Notes:

-
- Where `F` is a Type Class .


:::info

The `MAIN_NETWORK_ID` and `MAIN_LEDGER_ID` refer to the IDs of Topl's main network and ledger, respectfully. If you
wish to use a different network or ledger, you can find the IDs of all available networks and ledgers in the `NetworkConstants`
object.
