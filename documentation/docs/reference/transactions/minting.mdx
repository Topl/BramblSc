# Build a Minting Transaction

The first step to minting new tokens on the Topl Blockchain is to build an unproven minting transaction. There are three
types of tokens you can mint; group constructor tokens, series constructor tokens, and asset tokens. The transaction
builder offers a way to build each.

## Prerequisites

<InitTxBuilder/>

## Mint Group Constructor Tokens

You can create a transaction to mint new group constructor tokens using
the <ScaladocLink path="co/topl/brambl/builders/TransactionBuilderApi.html#buildGroupMintingTransaction(Seq[Txo],Predicate,GroupPolicy,Long,LockAddress,LockAddress,Long):F[Either[BuilderError,IoTransaction]]"><code>buildGroupMintingTransaction</code></ScaladocLink>
function of a Transaction Builder API instance.

```scala
def buildGroupMintingTransaction(
  txos:              Seq[Txo],
  lockPredicateFrom: Lock.Predicate,
  groupPolicy:       GroupPolicy,
  quantityToMint:    Long,
  mintedAddress:     LockAddress,
  changeAddress:     LockAddress,
  fee:               Long
): F[Either[BuilderError, IoTransaction]]
```

This function builds a transaction to mint group constructor tokens for a given Group Policy. These minted group
constructor tokens must be "registered" to an existing LVL UTXO. This registration UTXO is specified in the Group Policy and
must be included in the transaction inputs.

The parameters are as follows:
- `txos` - A sequence of TXOs to be the input of the created transaction. The registration UTXO (as specified in the
`groupPolicy`) must be included in this sequence. All TXOs must be encumbered by the same lock predicate, given by
`lockPredicateFrom`. You can obtain these TXOs from the [RPC queries](../rpc).
- `lockPredicateFrom` - The Predicate Lock that encumbers all the TXOs in `txos`.
- `groupPolicy` - The Group Policy for which to mint new group constructor tokens.
- `quantityToMint` - The quantity of group constructor tokens to mint.
- `mintedAddress` - A new LockAddress for which the minted group constructor tokens will be encumbered. You can create a
new Lock and LockAddress [with the SDK](./locks).
- `changeAddress` - A new LockAddress for which all the change UTXOs from `txos` will be encumbered. You can create a new
Lock and LockAddress [with the SDK](./locks).
- `fee` - The transaction fee. The `txos` must contain enough LVLs to satisfy this fee.

## Mint Series Constructor Tokens

You can create a transaction to mint new series constructor tokens using
the <ScaladocLink path="co/topl/brambl/builders/TransactionBuilderApi.html#buildSeriesMintingTransaction(Seq[Txo],Predicate,SeriesPolicy,Long,LockAddress,LockAddress,Long):F[Either[BuilderError,IoTransaction]]"><code>buildSeriesMintingTransaction</code></ScaladocLink>
function of a Transaction Builder API instance.

```scala
def buildSeriesMintingTransaction(
  txos:              Seq[Txo],
  lockPredicateFrom: Lock.Predicate,
  seriesPolicy:      SeriesPolicy,
  quantityToMint:    Long,
  mintedAddress:     LockAddress,
  changeAddress:     LockAddress,
  fee:               Long
): F[Either[BuilderError, IoTransaction]]
```

This function builds a transaction to mint series constructor tokens for a given Series Policy. These minted series
constructor tokens must be "registered" to an existing LVL UTXO. This registration UTXO is specified in the Series Policy
and must be included in the transaction inputs.

The parameters are as follows:
- `txos` - A sequence of TXOs to be the input of the created transaction. The registration UTXO (as specified in the
`seriesPolicy`) must be included in this sequence. All TXOs must be encumbered by the same lock predicate, given by
`lockPredicateFrom`. You can obtain these TXOs from the [RPC queries](../rpc).
- `lockPredicateFrom` - The Predicate Lock that encumbers all the TXOs in `txos`.
- `seriesPolicy` - The Series Policy for which to mint new series constructor tokens.
- `quantityToMint` - The quantity of series constructor tokens to mint.
- `mintedAddress` - A new LockAddress for which the minted series constructor tokens will be encumbered. You can create a
new Lock and LockAddress [with the SDK](./locks).
- `changeAddress` - A new LockAddress for which all the change UTXOs from `txos` will be encumbered. You can create a new
Lock and LockAddress [with the SDK](./locks).
- `fee` - The transaction fee. The `txos` must contain enough LVLs to satisfy this fee.
