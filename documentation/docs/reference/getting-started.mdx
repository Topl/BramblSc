## Installation

### Quick Start

The Scala Brambl SDK is published to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/co.topl/brambl-sdk_2.13) and is
built for Scala 2.13. To use it in your project, add the following to your `build.sbt`:

```scala title="build.sbt"
val bramblVersion = "2.0.0" // replace with the latest version

libraryDependencies += "co.topl" %% "brambl-sdk" % bramblVersion
```

### Service Kit

Wallet functionality in the Brambl SDK requires an implementation of a `ServiceKit` which is responsible for implementing
any un-implemented, application-specific, traits in
the <ScaladocLink path="co/topl/brambl/dataApi/index.html"><code>DataApi</code></ScaladocLink>
package. Specifically, handling data persistence. The SDK provides a default implementation of
the <ScaladocLink path="co/topl/brambl/servicekit/index.html"><code>ServiceKit</code></ScaladocLink>
that is published to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/co.topl/service-kit_2.13) for your convenience.
This default implementation uses local storage and SQLite. To use it in your project, add the following to your `build.sbt`:

```scala title="build.sbt"
val bramblVersion = "2.0.0" // replace with the latest version

libraryDependencies += "co.topl" %% "service-kit" % bramblVersion
```

### Other Libraries

There are 3 other Topl libraries relevant to the SDK; [`crypto`](https://search.maven.org/artifact/co.topl/crypto_2.13),
[`quivr4s`](https://search.maven.org/artifact/co.topl/quivr4s_2.13),
and [`protobuf`](https://search.maven.org/artifact/co.topl/protobuf-fs2_2.13). These libraries are not required to be added
to a project since they are mainly meant to be used internally by the SDK. However, advanced users may find them useful
to use to implement their own custom functionality in their application.

## Contributing

The Brambl SDK is completely open source and we welcome contributions. To get started, check out
