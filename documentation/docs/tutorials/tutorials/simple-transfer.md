## Use Case

Coming Soon (send 10 LVLs from one wallet to another). 

In this tutorial, we have 2 users, each with their own wallet. The first is the Sender, the second is the recipient.

For the purposes of this tutorial, we will assume that the Sender already has an initialized wallet with 100 LVLs.
The sender wants to send 10 LVLs to the recipient.

To illustrate setting up a wallet, the Recipient will create and initialize a new wallet.

## Set-Up

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to initialize and fund the Sender's wallet with 100 LVLs.

Following the instructions in the [Load Wallet with Funds](./obtain-funds) tutorial, you can initialize and fund the Sender's wallet.
