## Use Case

Coming Soon (send 10 LVLs from one wallet to another). 

In this tutorial, we have 2 users, each with their own wallet. The first is the Sender, the second is the recipient.

For the purposes of this tutorial, we will assume that the Sender already has an initialized wallet with 100 LVLs.
The sender wants to send 10 LVLs to the recipient.

To illustrate setting up a wallet, the Recipient will create and initialize a new wallet.

## Set-Up
Throughout this tutorial, we will be alternating between the Sender and the Recipient's Point-of-View. To distinguish 
between the two, each section will be prefixed with either "Sender >" or "Recipient >". We will also keep all the 
generated files (key file, wallet file, etc.) in separate folders for each user. These folders should be created and be empty
in advance.

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to initialize and fund the Sender's wallet with 100 LVLs. 

If you were following the instructions in the [Load Wallet with Funds](./obtain-funds) tutorial, the code to set up the 
Senders wallet should look something like:

```scala title="Initializing the Sender's Wallet and Funding it with 100 LVLs"

```

After running that file, you should see that the Sender's wallet has been initialized with 100 LVLs:

```bash title="output"

```

Keep the same local node instance running. We will be using it for the rest of this tutorial.
